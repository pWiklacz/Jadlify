  Test-driven development with red-green-refactor loop for phrAIse. Use when user wants to build features or fix bugs using TDD, mentions "red-green-refactor", wants integration tests, asks for test-first development, or when a task file contains `TDD Policy: Required: Yes` / `TDD / Test-First Plan`.

# Test-Driven Development

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe _what_ the system does, not _how_ it does it. A good test reads like a specification - "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means (like querying a database directly instead of using the interface). The warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed. If you rename an internal function and tests fail, those tests were testing implementation, not behavior.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## phrAIse Rules

Use this section before generic TDD habits. It adapts the loop to this repository.

- Treat task files from `task-planner` as the test plan when they contain `TDD Policy: Required: Yes` or `TDD / Test-First Plan`.
- Do not ask the user to confirm interfaces or behaviors when the task file, acceptance criteria, feature spec, or `decisions.md` already defines them. Ask only for real conflicts or blockers.
- Use the repo scripts for verification: `pwsh ./.scripts/test-min.ps1`, `pwsh ./.scripts/build-min.ps1`, `pwsh ./.scripts/format-min.ps1`, and `pwsh ./.scripts/verify-min.ps1`. Prefer scoped test filters during the red-green loop.
- Never call paid or production services in tests. Do not use real Groq, OpenAI, Supabase, Lemon Squeezy, or service-role credentials.
- API behavior tests should normally use xUnit, FluentAssertions, `WebApplicationFactory`, and WireMock.Net through existing fixtures.
- Desktop behavior tests should normally use xUnit, FluentAssertions, NSubstitute, `FakeTimeProvider`, and existing service/MVVM seams. Use Avalonia.Headless for real UI interaction tests when the task requires UI behavior.
- Prompt or AI-output quality should not rely on brittle exact-string assertions as the main gate. Use deterministic contract tests for local seams and repo-standard eval tooling when the task asks for prompt quality validation.
- Tests must protect local-first and stateless guarantees: user-dictated text stays local, and backend tests must not assert or introduce text persistence/logging.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This is "horizontal slicing" - treating RED as "write all tests" and GREEN as "write all code."

This produces **crap tests**:

- Tests written in bulk test _imagined_ behavior, not _actual_ behavior
- You end up testing the _shape_ of things (data structures, function signatures) rather than user-facing behavior
- Tests become insensitive to real changes - they pass when behavior breaks, fail when behavior is fine
- You outrun your headlights, committing to test structure before understanding the implementation

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test → one implementation → repeat. Each test responds to what you learned from the previous cycle. Because you just wrote the code, you know exactly what behavior matters and how to verify it.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED→GREEN: test1→impl1
  RED→GREEN: test2→impl2
  RED→GREEN: test3→impl3
  ...
```

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

When exploring the codebase, use the project's domain glossary so that test names and interface vocabulary match the project's language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Before writing production code:

- [ ] Read the task's `TDD Policy`, `TDD / Test-First Plan`, acceptance criteria, and relevant `decisions.md`
- [ ] Identify the next single behavior to prove
- [ ] Choose the existing test project, fixture, and scoped verification command
- [ ] Identify opportunities for [deep modules](deep-modules.md) (small interface, deep implementation)
- [ ] Design interfaces for [testability](interface-design.md)
- [ ] List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps) when the task does not already list them

Ask the user only when the task leaves a high-impact behavior or public contract genuinely ambiguous.

**You can't test everything.** Confirm with the user exactly which behaviors matter most. Focus testing effort on critical paths and complex logic, not every possible edge case.

### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing about the system:

```
RED:   Write test for first behavior → test fails
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass → test passes
```

This is your tracer bullet - proves the path works end-to-end.

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior:

```
RED:   Write next test → fails
GREEN: Minimal code to pass → passes
```

Rules:

- One test at a time
- Run the scoped test and confirm the failure is expected before editing production code
- Only enough code to pass current test
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior

### 4. Refactor

After all tests pass, look for [refactor candidates](refactoring.md):

- [ ] Extract duplication
- [ ] Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles where natural
- [ ] Consider what new code reveals about existing code
- [ ] Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.

## Checklist Per Cycle

```
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] RED was observed for the expected reason
[ ] GREEN was observed with the scoped command
[ ] Test would survive internal refactor
[ ] Code is minimal for this test
[ ] No speculative features added
```

## TDD Evidence

When this skill is used from `implement-task`, report concise evidence in the final response or PR body:

```markdown
## TDD Evidence
- `<TestName>`: RED with `<command>` because <expected missing behavior>; GREEN with `<command>` after implementation.
- Skipped TDD: <only when `TDD Policy: Required: No` gives the reason>.
```
