# Responsive App Shell Implementation Plan

## Overview

Stand up Jadlify's first frontend: a Vite + React + TypeScript single-page app (styled with Tailwind CSS), built into the ASP.NET Core API's `wwwroot` and served single-origin by the existing API host. The shell provides authentication *plumbing* — a Supabase JS session, a Bearer-attaching API client, and a route guard — plus a responsive app-bar/drawer layout with placeholder routes for the MVP sections. It deliberately does **not** build the real sign-in/registration/sign-out screens (S-01) or any feature pages (S-02…S-06).

This is roadmap foundation **F-03**. Its only prerequisite (F-01 account-data-boundary) and its parallel sibling (F-02 persistent-user-resources) are already implemented and merged.

## Current State Analysis

- **Backend is mature.** F-01 delivered Supabase JWT bearer validation in `src/Jadlify.API/Program.cs`: `JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultMapInboundClaims = false`, a `JwtBearer` scheme bound to `SupabaseJwtOptions`, and a **global fallback authorization policy** that requires an authenticated user with the `sub` claim. `/health` is the only `AllowAnonymous` runtime endpoint. F-02 added EF Core/Npgsql persistence, repositories, and `MacroCalculator`. No domain HTTP endpoints exist yet — only `/health` and scaffolded OpenAPI.
- **No frontend exists.** There is no `package.json`, no `node_modules`, no client app. The repo is .NET-only (`Jadlify.slnx` with five `src/` projects and four `tests/` projects).
- **Hosting model is already decided** (`context/foundation/infrastructure.md`): build React to static assets, serve them from the ASP.NET Core app at a single origin, with `index.html` fallback routing. No CORS, no split deploy. "Getting Started" step 1 states the production build must be copied into the ASP.NET Core static asset directory with fallback routing to `index.html`.
- **CI is .NET-only** (`.github/workflows/deploy-azure-app-service.yml`): on push to `main`, restore → build → test `Jadlify.slnx` → `dotnet publish` the API → ZIP-deploy to Azure App Service F1 (`jadlify-mvp-wikla`). There is no Node setup and no frontend step.
- **Auth contract is fixed** (`docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md`): `ICurrentUser.UserId` returns an `ApplicationUserId` whose `.Value` is the literal Supabase `sub`. Inbound claim remapping is disabled. The browser may use Supabase only for auth/session; all domain data must go through the API.
- **API test harness pattern exists** (`tests/Jadlify.API.Tests/Authentication/AuthBoundaryTests.cs`): a `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` subclass swaps in a `TestAuthenticationHandler` keyed on the bearer token string (`"invalid"` → fail, `"missing-sub"` → no `sub` claim, anything else → `sub=<token>`). New endpoint tests should reuse this pattern.
- `.gitignore` already ignores `node_modules/` and `.env`, and has a commented `#wwwroot/` line ready to enable.
- Backend dev URLs: `https://localhost:7206` (HTTPS) and `http://localhost:5182` (HTTP).

## Desired End State

After this plan:

- `npm run dev` in `src/Jadlify.Web/` runs a Vite dev server that proxies `/api/*` (and the `/api/me` call) to the running ASP.NET Core backend, with HMR.
- `dotnet publish src/Jadlify.API/Jadlify.API.csproj -c Release` produces a publish output whose `wwwroot/` contains the built SPA, and visiting `/` serves `index.html`. Deep links (e.g. `/products`) also serve `index.html` (client-side routing), while `/api/*` and `/health` behave as API/health endpoints.
- Anonymous visitors can load the SPA (so they can reach the future login screen), but `GET /api/me` returns `401` without a valid token and `200` with the authenticated user's `sub` when a token is present.
- The SPA boots a Supabase session, attaches the current access token as a Bearer header on API calls via a typed client, and a route guard redirects unauthenticated users to a `/login` placeholder. A post-login landing renders the `/api/me` result, proving the protected round-trip.
- The app renders a responsive shell: an app bar with navigation that collapses to a drawer on mobile, and placeholder protected routes for the MVP sections.
- CI builds and quality-gates the frontend (`npm run lint`, `npm test`) and the existing `dotnet publish` step bundles the SPA into `wwwroot` via an MSBuild target, all before the Azure deploy.

### Key Discoveries:

- The **global fallback authorization policy** in `src/Jadlify.API/Program.cs:55` applies to any endpoint without its own auth metadata. The SPA's `MapFallbackToFile` endpoint and static assets must be `AllowAnonymous`, or anonymous users cannot load the login page — `UseStaticFiles()` itself short-circuits before authorization, but the fallback *endpoint* is subject to the policy.
- The `sub`-as-`ApplicationUserId` contract (`docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md`, `HttpContextCurrentUser`) means `/api/me` can return the identity with zero new persistence — it just reads `ICurrentUser`.
- The test handler in `AuthBoundaryTests.cs` lets `/api/me` tests assert `401`/`200`/subject deterministically without real Supabase tokens.
- `infrastructure.md` already mandates the static-hosting model, so no architecture choice is open here — only the wiring.

## What We're NOT Doing

- **No real sign-in / registration / sign-out UI.** The shell ships a `/login` *placeholder* and auth plumbing only; the working account flow is roadmap slice **S-01**.
- **No feature pages.** Products, recipes, meal plan, goals, and shopping list get placeholder routes only — their UIs are S-02…S-06.
- **No new domain endpoints** beyond the single authenticated `/api/me` session probe.
- **No CORS / split deployment.** Single-origin static hosting per `infrastructure.md`.
- **No SSR / Next.js.** Static SPA only.
- **No Playwright / E2E** in this change (Vitest + RTL unit/component tests only).
- **No Supabase Row Level Security or direct browser-to-table access.** All domain data continues to go through the API.
- **No real secrets committed.** Supabase URL + anon key are injected via `.env` (gitignored) and Azure app settings; only `.env.example` is committed.

## Implementation Approach

Build inward-to-outward and backend-before-its-consumer:

1. Scaffold the frontend project and wire it into both the local dev loop (Vite proxy) and the production build (MSBuild target → `wwwroot`), plus ASP.NET Core static + SPA-fallback serving. This phase is verifiable on its own: the built SPA is served by the API.
2. Add the authenticated `/api/me` endpoint the frontend will consume, with API tests proving the auth boundary holds for it.
3. Wire frontend auth plumbing (Supabase session, Bearer client, TanStack Query `useMe`, route guard) that consumes `/api/me`.
4. Layer the responsive shell (app bar + drawer + placeholder routes) and integrate the frontend quality gate into CI.
5. Provision a local Supabase dev stack (Supabase CLI) that coexists with other local stacks on the same machine, and wire the API to validate its tokens — unblocking the manual auth round-trip checks deferred from Phases 2 and 3 (2.3/2.4, 3.4–3.6).

## Critical Implementation Details

- **SPA fallback vs. auth fallback policy (ordering + anonymous).** In `Program.cs`, place `app.UseStaticFiles()` before `UseAuthentication()`/`UseAuthorization()`, and register `app.MapFallbackToFile("index.html").AllowAnonymous()` after them. Without `AllowAnonymous`, the global fallback policy returns 401 for the SPA entrypoint and anonymous users can never reach the login screen. `/api/me` must live under the `/api` prefix so the SPA fallback does not shadow it and the Vite dev proxy can target `/api`.
- **MSBuild target needs Node on the runner.** The publish-time target shells out to `npm`. CI must run `actions/setup-node` before the `dotnet publish` step, even though the explicit lint/test step also installs Node. Make the target run only on publish (and Release build), not on every inner-loop `dotnet build`, to avoid slowing backend iteration.
- **Token freshness.** The API client must read the access token from the *current* Supabase session at call time (not cache it at startup), so a refreshed token is used after Supabase rotates it.

## Phase 1: Frontend Scaffold + Build/Dev Integration

### Overview

Create the Vite + React + TypeScript project with Tailwind, ESLint, and Vitest; wire the local dev proxy and the production MSBuild build-into-`wwwroot`; make ASP.NET Core serve the SPA with an anonymous `index.html` fallback.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Frontend project scaffold

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/` (new project: `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig*.json`, `index.html`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`)

**Intent**: Scaffold a Vite React-TS SPA that will own all client code. Keep it a plain npm project (not a `.csproj`) living under `src/` per the AGENTS.md "runtime code under src/" convention.

**Contract**: `package.json` exposes scripts `dev`, `build`, `preview`, `lint`, `test`. Build output goes to `src/Jadlify.Web/dist`. Node engine pinned to an LTS major.

#### 2. Tailwind CSS

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/` (Tailwind + PostCSS config, base stylesheet imported in `main.tsx`)

**Intent**: Add Tailwind as the styling/responsive system so later phases use utility breakpoints.

**Contract**: Tailwind content globs cover `index.html` and `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`; base directives present in the global stylesheet.

#### 3. ESLint + Vitest + React Testing Library

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/` (ESLint flat config, Vitest config with jsdom + RTL setup file)

**Intent**: Establish the frontend quality tooling so the route guard and session context get unit/component coverage in Phase 3.

**Contract**: `npm run lint` and `npm test` run clean on the scaffold. Vitest uses the `jsdom` environment and an RTL/jest-dom setup file.

#### 4. Vite dev proxy

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/vite.config.ts`

**Intent**: Forward API calls to the running backend during local dev so there is no CORS and one mental model matches production.

**Contract**: `server.proxy` routes `/api` (and `/health` if used) to `https://localhost:7206` with `secure: false` (dev self-signed cert) and `changeOrigin: true`.

#### 5. MSBuild publish target (SPA → wwwroot)

**File**: `src/Jadlify.API/Jadlify.API.csproj`

**Intent**: Make `dotnet publish` build the SPA and emit it into the API's `wwwroot` so the existing CI publish step produces a single deployable artifact with no workflow change to the publish command itself.

**Contract**: A target that runs after/within publish executes `npm ci` + `npm run build` in `src/Jadlify.Web`, then includes `src/Jadlify.Web/dist/**` as published content under `wwwroot/`. Guard it to publish (and Release build) only, not every `dotnet build`. The `SpaRoot`/output path is a property so it is defined once.

#### 6. ASP.NET Core static + SPA fallback serving

**File**: `src/Jadlify.API/Program.cs`

**Intent**: Serve the built SPA from `wwwroot` and route client-side deep links to `index.html`, while keeping the API and health endpoints intact and the auth boundary unbroken.

**Contract**: `app.UseStaticFiles()` before auth middleware; `app.MapFallbackToFile("index.html").AllowAnonymous()` registered after `UseAuthorization()`. `/health` and future `/api/*` endpoints are unaffected. See Critical Implementation Details for ordering and the anonymous requirement.

#### 7. Ignore build artifacts

**File**: `.gitignore`

**Intent**: Keep generated frontend output and the API `wwwroot` out of source control.

**Contract**: `node_modules/` and `.env` already ignored; enable `wwwroot/` (uncomment the existing line) and add `src/Jadlify.Web/dist/`.

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:

- Frontend installs and builds: `npm ci && npm run build` in `src/Jadlify.Web` produces `dist/`
- Frontend lint passes: `npm run lint`
- Frontend test runner executes (scaffold smoke test): `npm test`
- Publish bundles the SPA: `dotnet publish src/Jadlify.API/Jadlify.API.csproj -c Release -o .publish` yields `.publish/wwwroot/index.html`
- Backend still builds and tests green: `pwsh ./.scripts/verify-min.ps1`

#### Manual Verification:

- Running the published app serves the SPA at `/` and a deep link like `/products` returns `index.html` (not 404)
- `npm run dev` (Vite) with the backend running proxies an `/api`/`/health` request to the backend without CORS errors
- `/health` still returns 200 anonymously after the static/fallback wiring

**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.

---

## Phase 2: Authenticated `/api/me` Endpoint

### Overview

Add a single minimal protected endpoint the frontend uses to confirm its token reaches the backend, and prove the auth boundary holds for it with API tests.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. `GET /api/me` endpoint

**File**: `src/Jadlify.API/Program.cs` (or a small endpoint module it calls)

**Intent**: Expose the authenticated user's id so the SPA can verify a real protected round-trip. No persistence — read `ICurrentUser`.

**Contract**: `GET /api/me` requires authentication (no `AllowAnonymous`; relies on the global fallback policy). Returns `200` with a JSON body containing the user id (`ICurrentUser.UserId.Value`). Anonymous → `401`. Lives under `/api` so the SPA fallback does not shadow it.

#### 2. API tests for `/api/me`

**File**: `tests/Jadlify.API.Tests/` (new test class, e.g. `Session/SessionEndpointTests.cs`)

**Intent**: Lock the auth boundary for the new endpoint using the existing test harness.

**Contract**: Reuse the `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` + `TestAuthenticationHandler` pattern from `AuthBoundaryTests.cs`. Assert: anonymous → `401`; `missing-sub` token → `403`; valid token (`"user-123"`) → `200` and body contains `user-123`.

#### 3. Contract-surface registry update

**File**: `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md`

**Intent**: Record `/api/me` and the SPA hosting boundary so later slices reuse rather than duplicate them.

**Contract**: Add a section noting `GET /api/me` is the authenticated session probe returning the `sub`, and that the SPA is served from API `wwwroot` with an anonymous `index.html` fallback while `/api/*` stays protected.

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:

- New endpoint tests pass: `pwsh ./.scripts/test-min.ps1 -Project tests/Jadlify.API.Tests`
- Full backend verify is green: `pwsh ./.scripts/verify-min.ps1`

#### Manual Verification:

- With the backend running, `GET /api/me` without a token returns `401`
- `GET /api/me` with a valid Supabase access token returns `200` and the expected `sub`

**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Auth Plumbing + API Client

### Overview

Wire the client-side session and the API access layer the rest of the app depends on: a Supabase session source, a typed Bearer-attaching fetch client, TanStack Query with a `useMe()` round-trip, and a route guard that redirects unauthenticated users to a `/login` placeholder.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Supabase client + session context

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/src/` (Supabase client module + a React session provider/hook)

**Intent**: Initialize the Supabase JS client and expose the current session/user/token to the app through context, reacting to Supabase auth state changes.

**Contract**: Reads `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from env. Exposes a hook returning `{ session, isLoading }` (or equivalent) and subscribes to `onAuthStateChange`. No UI here.

#### 2. Typed API client with auto-Bearer

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/src/` (fetch wrapper module)

**Intent**: Centralize API calls and attach the current access token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` at call time.

**Contract**: A typed wrapper around `fetch` that resolves the token from the *current* Supabase session per request (see Critical Implementation Details — token freshness), targets relative `/api/...` URLs, and surfaces non-2xx as typed errors.

#### 3. TanStack Query provider + `useMe()`

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/src/` (Query client provider wrapping the app + a `useMe` query)

**Intent**: Establish the data-fetching pattern (loading/error/pending states satisfying the responsiveness NFR) that S-02…S-06 will follow, and prove the protected round-trip.

**Contract**: `QueryClientProvider` wraps the router. `useMe()` calls `GET /api/me` via the API client and is enabled only when a session exists.

#### 4. Route guard + `/login` placeholder

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/src/` (guard component + placeholder login route + post-login landing)

**Intent**: Protect app routes and give anonymous users a destination, without building the real auth form (S-01).

**Contract**: Guard renders the protected outlet when a session is present and redirects to `/login` otherwise (and shows nothing/loader while the session resolves). `/login` is a public placeholder clearly marked as wired in S-01. The landing route renders the `useMe()` result to demonstrate the round-trip.

#### 5. Env contract

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/.env.example`

**Intent**: Document the required public Supabase config without committing real values.

**Contract**: `.env.example` lists `VITE_SUPABASE_URL=` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=`. Real `.env` stays gitignored; production values come from Azure app settings at build time.

#### 6. Auth-plumbing tests

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/src/` (Vitest/RTL tests)

**Intent**: Cover the load-bearing plumbing before feature slices build on it.

**Contract**: Tests assert the guard redirects to `/login` with no session and renders children with a session (mocked), and that the API client attaches the Bearer header from the session token.

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:

- Frontend tests pass: `npm test` in `src/Jadlify.Web`
- Lint passes: `npm run lint`
- Production build still succeeds: `npm run build`

#### Manual Verification:

- With a valid Supabase session, the landing page shows the user id returned by `/api/me`
- Without a session, navigating to a protected route redirects to `/login`
- After the Supabase token refreshes, a subsequent `/api/me` call still succeeds (token read fresh)

**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.

---

## Phase 4: Responsive Shell Layout + Navigation + CI

### Overview

Wrap the protected area in a responsive app-bar/drawer layout with placeholder routes for the MVP sections, and integrate the frontend quality gate into the deploy workflow.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Responsive app shell layout

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/src/` (layout component + nav)

**Intent**: Provide the persistent shell — top app bar with navigation that collapses to a drawer/hamburger on mobile, wrapping a content outlet — meeting the device/browser NFR.

**Contract**: Tailwind breakpoints drive desktop nav vs. mobile drawer (toggle state for open/closed). The app bar has a brand area and an account-area placeholder slot (sign-out wiring belongs to S-01). Layout renders the routed content outlet.

#### 2. Placeholder section routes

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/src/` (router config + placeholder pages)

**Intent**: Give the navigation real destinations so later slices fill them in without restructuring routing.

**Contract**: Protected routes for products, recipes, meal plan, daily goals, and shopping list, each a minimal placeholder behind the guard. `/login` remains the public placeholder. Routing uses the SPA fallback for deep links (already wired in Phase 1).

#### 3. CI frontend quality gate

**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-azure-app-service.yml`

**Intent**: Lint and test the frontend in CI and ensure Node is available for the publish-time SPA build, before the Azure deploy.

**Contract**: Add `actions/setup-node` and a frontend step running `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` in `src/Jadlify.Web`, ordered before the existing `dotnet publish` step (whose MSBuild target performs the production SPA build). The deploy step is unchanged.

#### 4. Dev/run documentation

**File**: `AGENTS.md` (Build/Test/Run section) and a short `src/Jadlify.Web/README.md`

**Intent**: Record how to run the two-process dev loop and the frontend npm scripts so future agents stay unblocked.

**Contract**: Document `dotnet run` (backend) + `npm run dev` (Vite proxy) for local dev, and the `lint`/`test`/`build` scripts. Keep it concise.

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:

- Frontend lint + tests + build pass: `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build` in `src/Jadlify.Web`
- Full backend verify green: `pwsh ./.scripts/verify-min.ps1`
- Publish still bundles the SPA into `wwwroot`: `dotnet publish src/Jadlify.API/Jadlify.API.csproj -c Release -o .publish` yields `.publish/wwwroot/index.html`
- Workflow file is valid YAML and includes the Node setup + frontend step before publish

#### Manual Verification:

- On a desktop viewport the app bar shows inline navigation; on a narrow/mobile viewport it collapses to a working drawer/hamburger
- Each placeholder section route renders behind the guard and is reachable from the nav
- Interactions give visible feedback ≤200 ms and any >2 s load shows a progress indicator (responsiveness NFR)
- Usable on the latest Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari (desktop) and a current mobile browser, in both desktop and responsive-mobile modes

**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful.

---

## Phase 5: Local Supabase Dev Environment + Backend JWT Wiring

### Overview

Stand up a **local Supabase stack** (Supabase CLI + Docker) dedicated to Jadlify that coexists with another project's local Supabase on the same machine, and wire the ASP.NET Core API to validate the tokens that local stack issues. This unblocks the manual auth round-trip checks deferred from Phases 2 and 3 (2.3/2.4, 3.4–3.6) without changing production behavior.

The **coexistence mechanism**: the Supabase CLI namespaces all Docker containers/volumes by `project_id`, so two distinct `project_id`s are fully isolated stacks (separate DB, volumes, data). The only real conflict is host ports, resolved by giving Jadlify its own shifted port range.

The **validation wrinkle**: the Supabase CLI stack (v2.84.x) signs user access tokens **asymmetrically (ES256)** and publishes the public key via **JWKS / OIDC discovery served over HTTP**, while `Program.cs` hard-codes `RequireHttpsMetadata = true`. This phase makes `RequireHttpsMetadata` configurable so Development can discover the local stack's signing key over HTTP through the existing asymmetric path; Production keeps HTTPS discovery unchanged.

> **Implementation note (2026-05-29):** An earlier draft of this phase assumed local GoTrue signed tokens **HS256 with a shared symmetric secret** (true for older CLI versions). The installed CLI (v2.84.2) issues **ES256** user tokens via JWKS instead — `JWT_SECRET` now only signs the legacy `anon`/`service_role` keys. Per a decision during implementation, the symmetric `SigningKey` path was **dropped** in favour of the production-aligned asymmetric path plus a `RequireHttpsMetadata` dev toggle. The text below reflects the as-built asymmetric approach.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Local Supabase project config

**File**: `supabase/config.toml` (new, via `supabase init`)

**Intent**: Define a Jadlify-specific local stack that runs alongside another project's stack without port collisions.

**Contract**: `project_id = "jadlify"`; shift every host-published port to a dedicated range (api `54421`, db `54422`, db `shadow_port 54420`, pooler `54429`, studio `54423`, inbucket `54424`, analytics `54427`); set `[auth] site_url` to the Vite dev URL (`http://127.0.0.1:5173`) and include it in `additional_redirect_urls`. CLI-generated `supabase/.branches` and `supabase/.temp` are gitignored.

#### 2. HTTP metadata-discovery toggle (dev)

**File**: `src/Jadlify.API/Authentication/SupabaseJwtOptions.cs`

**Intent**: Allow Development to discover the local stack's (ES256) signing key over HTTP, without weakening the production HTTPS-discovery default.

**Contract**: Add `RequireHttpsMetadata` (bool, default `true`). Production leaves it `true`; only local dev sets it `false`. The `SigningKey` idea is dropped — Supabase signs asymmetrically, so there is no shared secret to validate against.

#### 3. Make the JWT bearer wiring honour `RequireHttpsMetadata`

**File**: `src/Jadlify.API/Program.cs`

**Intent**: Keep the single asymmetric JWKS path for all environments, with HTTPS-metadata enforcement configurable.

**Contract**: The JwtBearer wiring uses `Authority`/`MetadataAddress` for JWKS/OIDC discovery and sets `options.RequireHttpsMetadata = SupabaseJwtOptions.RequireHttpsMetadata`. `ValidIssuer`/`ValidAudience`/`NameClaimType=sub`/lifetime validation are unchanged across environments. The global fallback policy and the `sub`-as-`ApplicationUserId` contract are untouched. The options are bound from DI-resolved `IOptions<SupabaseJwtOptions>` (lazy) rather than an eager config snapshot, so test/host config overrides apply before the options bind.

#### 4. Local dev configuration values

**File**: API user-secrets (and the SPA `.env` — gitignored, documented only)

**Intent**: Point both processes at the local stack without committing secrets.

**Contract**: API user-secrets set `SupabaseAuth:Authority = http://127.0.0.1:54421/auth/v1`, `SupabaseAuth:Issuer = http://127.0.0.1:54421/auth/v1`, `SupabaseAuth:Audience = authenticated`, and `SupabaseAuth:RequireHttpsMetadata = false`. SPA `.env` sets `VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54421` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key from "supabase status">`. Real values stay out of git (only `.env.example` is committed). The API project gains a `UserSecretsId` so the Development host loads these automatically.

#### 5. Real-pipeline JWT validation test

**File**: `tests/Jadlify.API.Tests/` (new test class, `Authentication/AsymmetricJwtValidationTests.cs`)

**Intent**: Lock the asymmetric (ES256) validation path through the real `JwtBearer` middleware (the existing `AuthBoundaryTests` bypass it via `TestAuthenticationHandler`).

**Contract**: A `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` mints ES256 tokens in-test with an in-process ECDSA P-256 key, injecting that key's public part as the `IssuerSigningKey` (so no live JWKS endpoint is needed; JWKS/`kid` resolution against a real stack is left to manual verification). Assert: a well-formed token (correct issuer/audience/`sub`, unexpired) → `200` with the `sub`; a token signed with the wrong key or expired → `401`; a token missing `sub` → `403`.

#### 6. Dev setup documentation

**File**: `src/Jadlify.Web/README.md` and/or `AGENTS.md` (Build/Test/Run)

**Intent**: Record the local-Supabase coexistence setup so future agents/devs reproduce it.

**Contract**: Document `supabase start` (Jadlify stack on `544xx`), the `supabase status` values to copy into `.env` + user-secrets, how to create a local test user (GoTrue admin API with the service-role key, or local Studio at `:54423`), and the two-process dev loop. Keep it concise and complementary to (not duplicating) Phase 4's dev docs.

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:

- `supabase/config.toml` is committed with a unique `project_id` and the shifted port range (no service left on a default `5432x` port)
- New asymmetric-JWT test passes: correctly-signed ES256 token → `200`; wrong-key/expired → `401`; missing-`sub` → `403` (real `JwtBearer` pipeline)
- Full backend verify is green: `pwsh ./.scripts/verify-min.ps1`

#### Manual Verification:

- `supabase start` brings up the Jadlify stack on the `544xx` ports while another project's stack stays up on `5432x` — no port conflict; `supabase stop` stops only the Jadlify stack
- With `.env` + user-secrets set and a local test user, the SPA signs in and the landing shows the `/api/me` user id (unblocks 3.4/3.5)
- `GET /api/me` behaves correctly end-to-end: anonymous → `401`, valid token → `200` + `sub` (unblocks 2.3/2.4)
- After the Supabase access token refreshes, a subsequent `/api/me` call still succeeds (unblocks 3.6)

**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit / Component Tests (Vitest + RTL):

- Route guard: redirects to `/login` without a session; renders children with a session.
- API client: attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from the current session.
- Session context: exposes session and reacts to auth-state changes (mocked Supabase).

### Backend Tests (xUnit):

- `/api/me`: `401` anonymous, `403` authenticated-without-`sub`, `200` + subject with a valid token (reusing `TestAuthenticationHandler`).

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. Run backend (`dotnet run`) + `npm run dev`; confirm proxied `/api/me` behavior with and without a Supabase session.
2. Publish (`dotnet publish -c Release`) and run the published app; confirm `/`, a deep link, and `/health` behave correctly.
3. Resize between desktop and mobile widths; confirm the nav collapses to a drawer and back.
4. Verify the responsiveness NFR (≤200 ms feedback, progress indicator for >2 s).

## Performance Considerations

- The SPA is statically served from `wwwroot` on Azure App Service F1 (no SSR, no server render cost). Keep the initial bundle modest; the shell has few dependencies (React, router, TanStack Query, Supabase JS, Tailwind-generated CSS).
- TanStack Query's pending/loading states are the mechanism for the responsiveness NFR; rely on them rather than custom spinners per call.

## Migration Notes

- No data migration. Net-new frontend plus one read-only authenticated endpoint.
- CI gains Node setup; the publish command is unchanged because the MSBuild target builds the SPA into `wwwroot` during `dotnet publish`.

### Phase 1: Frontend Scaffold + Build/Dev Integration

#### Automated

- [x] 1.1 Frontend installs and builds (`npm ci && npm run build` → `dist/`) — 1885fac
- [x] 1.2 Frontend lint passes (`npm run lint`) — 1885fac
- [x] 1.3 Frontend test runner executes (`npm test`) — 1885fac
- [x] 1.4 Publish bundles the SPA (`dotnet publish -c Release` → `.publish/wwwroot/index.html`) — 1885fac
- [x] 1.5 Backend still builds and tests green (`pwsh ./.scripts/verify-min.ps1`) — 1885fac

#### Manual

- [x] 1.6 Published app serves SPA at `/` and deep link returns `index.html` — 1885fac
- [x] 1.7 `npm run dev` proxies `/api`/`/health` to backend without CORS errors — 1885fac
- [x] 1.8 `/health` still returns 200 anonymously — 1885fac

### Phase 2: Authenticated `/api/me` Endpoint

#### Automated

- [x] 2.1 New `/api/me` endpoint tests pass (`test-min.ps1 -Project tests/Jadlify.API.Tests`) — 00893f4
- [x] 2.2 Full backend verify is green (`pwsh ./.scripts/verify-min.ps1`) — 00893f4

#### Manual

- [ ] 2.3 `GET /api/me` without a token returns `401`
- [ ] 2.4 `GET /api/me` with a valid token returns `200` and the expected `sub`

### Phase 3: Frontend Auth Plumbing + API Client

#### Automated

- [x] 3.1 Frontend tests pass (`npm test`) — 82710b9
- [x] 3.2 Lint passes (`npm run lint`) — 82710b9
- [x] 3.3 Production build succeeds (`npm run build`) — 82710b9

#### Manual

- [ ] 3.4 Landing page shows the `/api/me` user id with a valid session
- [ ] 3.5 Protected route redirects to `/login` without a session
- [ ] 3.6 `/api/me` still succeeds after Supabase token refresh

### Phase 4: Responsive Shell Layout + Navigation + CI

#### Automated

- [x] 4.1 Frontend lint + tests + build pass — cff2012
- [x] 4.2 Full backend verify green (`pwsh ./.scripts/verify-min.ps1`) — cff2012
- [x] 4.3 Publish bundles SPA into `wwwroot` (`.publish/wwwroot/index.html`) — cff2012
- [x] 4.4 Workflow YAML valid with Node setup + frontend step before publish — cff2012

#### Manual

- [ ] 4.5 App bar shows inline nav on desktop, collapses to drawer on mobile
- [ ] 4.6 Each placeholder section route renders behind the guard and is reachable
- [ ] 4.7 Responsiveness NFR met (≤200 ms feedback, progress indicator for >2 s)
- [ ] 4.8 Usable on the four desktop browsers + a current mobile browser, desktop + responsive modes

### Phase 5: Local Supabase Dev Environment + Backend JWT Wiring

#### Automated

- [x] 5.1 `supabase/config.toml` committed with unique `project_id` + shifted port range — fa09c6d
- [x] 5.2 Asymmetric-JWT test passes (ES256→`200`, wrong-key/expired→`401`, missing-`sub`→`403`) — fa09c6d
- [x] 5.3 Full backend verify green (`pwsh ./.scripts/verify-min.ps1`) — fa09c6d

#### Manual

- [ ] 5.4 `supabase start` runs Jadlify stack on `544xx` alongside another project on `5432x` (no conflict)
- [ ] 5.5 SPA signs in with a local test user; landing shows `/api/me` user id (unblocks 3.4/3.5)
- [ ] 5.6 `/api/me` end-to-end: anonymous→`401`, valid→`200`+`sub` (unblocks 2.3/2.4)
- [ ] 5.7 Token refresh → `/api/me` still succeeds (unblocks 3.6)
